# Lab1B-Wordpress
In this lab, you make a wordpress blog.

## Example Wordpress Blogs
- [Example Software Engineer Blog](https://shannoncrabill.com/blog/)
- [General Blogs](https://colorlib.com/wp/blogs-using-wordpress/)

## Directions
Follow the instructions on wordpress and [start your blog](https://wordpress.com/create-blog/)

## First Post
Make your first post, talking about this set of labs. 
In it, link to your github account. 
Make the github account link easy to find. 
You can complete this outside of lab, if you so choose. 

## Class Blogs & Github Handles
Add your blog & github handle to the bottom of the list. 
To do so, click on the little pencil in the top right corner of the readme you are currently reading in the browser, make edits, a commit message, and commit directly to the master branch. (Once again, this is a bad habit, but okay for this first set of labs only).  
*May require admins to give you access - shall not know until lab runs*
